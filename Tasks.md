Task 1
Write a C++ program that accepts a matrix of characters and an arbitrary string, and checks whether that string is contained anywhere in the matrix. Use the <iostream> library only.

Task 2
Write a C++ program that accepts a matrix of numbers and applies convolution on the following principle: make each element equal to the average of all its neighboring elements. Print the new matrix. Use the <iostream> library only.

Task 3
Write a C++ program that accepts a matrix of decimal numbers and a string representing the number in hexadecimal notation. Check how many times the equivalent of the hexadecimal number in decimal is found in the matrix. Use the <iostream> library only.

Task 4
Write a C++ program that accepts a string. Find the number of words and the number of numbers in this string. The numbers can be in decimal or hexadecimal notation. Words are separated by an arbitrary amount of spaces(' '). Use the <iostream> library only.

Task 5
Write a C++ program that accepts a matrix of characters. Replace all uppercase characters with lowercase, and vice versa, replace all characters representing numbers with the * character, replace all other characters with the '0' character. Print the new matrix. Use the <iostream> library only.

Task 6
Write a C++ program that accepts a square matrix of numbers or symbols. Check if there is a row, column or diagonal that are identical to each other. Use the <iostream> library only.

Task 7
Write a C++ program that accepts a string. Check how many times each substring representing a number in a decimal notation occurs as a number in a hexadecimal notation (or vice versa). Use the <iostream> library only.
